The “Book My Turf” is an online sports turf playground booking system designed to streamline
the process of reserving sports turf playgrounds. Developed using Python, the system
incorporates three main modules: Admin, User, and Manager. The Admin module enables
administrators to manage user accounts, oversee booking activities, and maintain the overall
functionality of the system. Users, through the User module, can easily browse available turf
slots, make reservations, and view booking history, enhancing the convenience of accessing
sports facilities. Additionally, the Manager module empowers facility managers to monitor
bookings, track usage patterns, and optimize resource allocation for the sports turf playgrounds.
This project aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform that enhances the management
and accessibility of sports facilities for both administrators and users.
